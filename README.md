# IntegrationHelper
This repo is designed to help new developers setup integrations with Github and connecting their IDE to source control.

In order to begin contributing to a repo in Github, you must first provide authorization access from your account. This can be done a few different ways, the options below will help walk you through the common ways to do so:


### OAuth Application Authorization
This might sound complicated, but it's probably the fastest and easiest way to get up and running with your project

[Connect Android Studio directly to Github](docs/connect_as_github.md)

### SSH Key Authorization
Most likely used for the more experienced developer, setting up SSH keys not only allows you to push code up using any IDE, it's also used for developers who prefer to use Git from the command line.
